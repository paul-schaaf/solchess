# solchess
Chess game on Solana

possible optimisations/additions:
    - add turn timers and game length
    - play for crypto, winner gets input
    - improve legal_chess (see its readme)
    - game_arr could be stored in less bytes because you don't need an entire byte to save a piece
    - when should the game start? when 2nd player joins? or is there maybe a better way?
